# Amazon Web Services (AWS) Playbook
This playbook outlines an opinionated, best-practice way to install Rasa Pro and Rasa Studio on AWS. You may wish to adapt steps and configuration to meet your needs or organisational policies as required. The files here support you working through the AWS Playbook which you can find [here](https://rasa.com/docs/reference/deployment/aws/aws-playbook-intro).
